# ðŸ›’ Django E-commerce Platform

Hello! Welcome to my **Django E-commerce Platform** project. This is a robust and scalable web application built with Python and Django, designed to serve as a modern online store.

I developed this project to showcase my expertise in building functional and maintainable e-commerce solutions from the ground up.

## âœ¨ Key Features & My Contributions

This project demonstrates my proficiency in various aspects of web development, specifically tailored for an e-commerce context:

* **Core Django Development**: I've engineered the backbone of the application using **Django (4.2+)**, implementing models, views, and templates to create a fully functional online store.
* **Database Management**: Utilized `psycopg`/`psycopg-binary` for efficient and reliable interaction with **PostgreSQL** databases, ensuring robust data handling for products, orders, and users.
* **Secure Configuration**: Implemented `python-decouple` for managing environment variables, keeping sensitive information (like API keys and database credentials) out of the codebase.
* **Image Handling**: Integrated `Pillow` for efficient image processing, crucial for managing product images within the store.
* **Debugging & Performance**: Leveraged `django-debug-toolbar` for in-depth insights into application performance and debugging during development.
* **External Integrations**: Utilized `requests` for making HTTP requests, potentially for integrating with external payment gateways or third-party APIs.
* **Code Quality & Maintenance**: Focused on writing clean, well-structured code, ensuring maintainability and future scalability.
